The primary job of this mod is to fix the inability for Kerbals to find glove-boxes within their vessel or pockets on their EVA suits. You can now make crew reports and have them stored without the need to exit the vessel, take all of the reports out, then put them all back in again. It also allows Kerbals on EVA to store science data within pockets on their EVA suits.

Although this mod's primary goal is to alleviate the ridiculousness of crew report storage, it will also work with any other science experiments that have their own separate science containers within the same part. Experiment data will be automatically stored within these containers making room for further experiments.


Installation
------------

Place the `StoreMyReports` folder found within the downloaded zip file into the `GameData` found within the game's installation directory.


Configuration
-------------

To change these settings you can open the configuration dialog by clicking on the `SMR` button found on the toolbar at the bottom right of the Space Centre.

***Automatically Discard Duplicates***  
When enabled this feature will automatically discard any duplicate science data if it already exists within the container (i.e capsule for crew reports and kerbal for eva reports).


Version Checking
----------------
This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC. If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent. For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin.
