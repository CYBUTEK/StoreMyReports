# Store My Reports

The primary job of this mod is to fix the innability for Kerbals to find gloveboxes within their vessel
or pockets on their EVA suits. You can now make crew reports and have them stored without the need to
exit the vessel, take all of the reports out, then put them all back in again. It also allows Kerbals
on EVA to store science data within pockets on their EVA suits.

Although this mod's primary goal is to alleviate the ridiculousness of crew report storage, it will also
work with any other science experiments that have their own separate science containers within the same
part. Experiment data will be automatically stored within these containers making room for further
experiments.

Duplicate science data that doesn't fit within the container is discarded by default. Without this feature
the Kerbal just hangs onto the data in its hands until asked to discard via normal means. This can be
changed within the 'StoreMyReports.json' configuration file, but I can't see why anyone would actually
want to do this though.
